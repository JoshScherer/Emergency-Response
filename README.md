# Emergency-Response
CS 4266: Big Data Final Project

Josh Scherer & Alex Zhang

# Overview
In our project, we examine emergency response data by recognizing clusters of incidents and identifying spatial-temporal trends which can provide insight into how emergency response systems can be more effective. We take a data-driven approach to perform in-depth analysis on incident, traffic, weather, and census data to reveal trends and intricacies both spatially and temporally.

# What we investigated:
* Frequency of Incidents by Census Tract
* Temporal Analysis of Incidents by Month
* Response Time Distribution by Census Tract
* Weather Correlation to Incident Rates
* Weather Correlation to Response Time

# File Organization
Since we were working in a group and tackling different problems simultaneously, these investigations can be found across different files

### Frequency of Incidents by Census Tract
Can be found in the AssignedQueries.ipynb file

### Temporal Analysis of Incidents by Month
Can be found in the following:
* Initial-Query-Exploration.ipynb
* FindingOutSpark.ipynb

### Response Time Distribution by Census Tract
Can be found in the following:
* AssignedQueries.ipynb file
* ER_jobs.ipynb

### Weather Correlation to Incident Rates
Can be found in the FiguringOutSpark.ipynb file

### Weather Correlation to Response Time
Can be found in the FiguringOutSpark.ipynb file

### Misc. Findings
Can be found throughout
